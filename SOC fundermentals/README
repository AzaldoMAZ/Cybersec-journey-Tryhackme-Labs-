Overview:
This project summarizes what I learned from the SOC Fundamentals room on TryHackMe. It explores the core concepts, roles, and technologies involved in a Security Operations Center (SOC), emphasizing how organizations detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.

üîç Key Learnings

SOC Purpose:
A SOC continuously monitors and protects an organization‚Äôs IT infrastructure, detecting and responding to potential threats 24/7.

Core Pillars:
The foundation of an effective SOC relies on People, Process, and Technology, working together to ensure security operations run smoothly.

SOC Roles:
Learned how different SOC levels function ‚Äî from Level 1 Analysts handling alert triage to Detection Engineers who design alerting rules and improve detection logic.

Processes & Investigation:
Applied the 5 Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why) method to analyze incidents and derive meaningful conclusions during investigations.

Security Technologies:
Explored tools like Firewalls for network traffic control and SIEMs for log aggregation, detection, and alerting.

Practical Exercise:
Practiced incident analysis by identifying a simulated port scan, verifying its intent, and closing the alert with proper documentation.

üèÅ Takeaway

This lab provided a strong foundation in how SOCs operate, how incidents are triaged and analyzed, and how security technologies interconnect to maintain organizational resilience.
